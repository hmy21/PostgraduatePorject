#### 9.17 

the essential lesson in the first lesson in VE is download the Maya. I think I could learn on the video website.(before the 9.19lesson)

#### 9.19 VE Design

Learnt the Maya's basic operation: W, E, R, Space, Shift... I reckon that I should learn it more and exercise it  which makes me more skilful.

#### 9.20    

In the morning, I join the first seminar lesson.  It is really a small lesson. Just only 13-15 persons joined it in group 1.

in the afternoon lesson, it tells me that I should use DaVinci **Resolve Studio** for our editing and post-production work.

We have gotten a team which is 6 people in there to complete a team work

#### 9.24 

**Introduction**

Told the history of VR and AR.



**VE Design**

Summary

Colin Dalton explains the process of modeling 3D objects using Lyd, emphasizing the transition from primitives to more complex structures. He demonstrates creating a cube, manipulating faces, vertices, and edges, and introduces the concept of subdivision to increase the number of faces for higher detail. Dalton highlights the importance of edge flow and loops for efficient modeling, showing how to insert them to create smooth, controlled subdivisions. He concludes by illustrating the transformation of a polygon sphere into a human head, emphasizing the power of precise vertex manipulation and edge control to achieve detailed 3D models.

Action items
• [] Explore subdividing objects and using edge loops to add detail.
• [] Practice modeling a human head shape from a basic sphere.
• [] Review the lab exercises on Thursday to further develop these modeling techniques.
